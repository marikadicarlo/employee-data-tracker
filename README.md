# Description
This application is a command-line application that allows the user to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. 
This application is not meant to be deployed, so there is a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.
Unfortunately, I ran into three major issues while creating this application. I am not able to deploy viewAllEmployees(), viewAllRoles() and viewAllDepartments(). 
All other functions work properly, and I am still working on fixing these issues, and will update this application when I have solved the issue.

## User Story
